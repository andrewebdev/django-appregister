Django appregister
========================================

Django appregister is a building blocks app to implement a registry system for
your django app. It uses a similar approach to the Django admin, allowing you
to register classes and supports an autodiscover feature to find classes that
follow a naming convention within your app (in the same way that putting
ModelAdmin sublcassic in an admin.py is a convention.)

See http://appregister.readthedocs.org/ for further documentation.
